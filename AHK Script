; This was done very quickly, so there is no validation checks programmed in.

; Make sure both "Mass MailID Owner Change.xlsm" is open
; and that you have a mothra session named "AutoMothra" opened and it currently looking at the Change MailID Owner screen

; Column A of the workbook should have all the MailIDs that should be changed. With no formatting
; Modify the MothraID below if needed

; DOWN BELOW, MAKE SURE TO PUT A MOTHRAID!

#q::
	WinActivate, Mass MailID Owner Change.xlsm - Excel
	Sleep, 300
	Xl := ComObjActive("Excel.Application") ;creates a handle to your Application object
	xl.Run("GrabFirstMailID")
	CurrentMailID = %clipboard%
	StringReplace, CurrentMailID,CurrentMailID, `r,, All
	StringReplace, CurrentMailID,CurrentMailID, `n,, All
	xl.Run("MoveBgetouttheway")
	
	WinActivate, AutoMothra
